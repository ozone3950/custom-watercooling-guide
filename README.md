# Custom Watercooling Guide

## Introduction

Custom watercooling is mainly used for high end components in order to cool them sufficiently when overclocked. Parts are bought seperately, making it more customisable. They also cool a lot better than mainstream AIO liquid coolers. 

# Parts

## CPU Blocks
The CPU block is the part of the loop which cools the CPU, like the name suggests. It is mounted onto it like a regular CPU cooler, but has two tubes going into it, screwed on by fittings.

Heatkiller IV PRO
Optimus Signature V2


## GPU blocks 
Very similar to CPU blocks, but the GPU block usually goes onto the entire card to cool the VRAM and VRMs, and often has a backplate. Although, there are GPU blocks that only mount onto the chip.

##### Heatkiller IV
##### Heatkiller V


## Radiators
As the component which is being cooled heats up, so does the water that it is being cooled by. The water flows through the radiator and is cooled by the fans.

##### Black Ice Nemesis GTS Series
##### Black Ice Nemesis GTX Series
##### Corsair Hydro X XR5 Series
##### Corsair Hydro X XR7 Series


## Fans
Fans cool the radiator, since they get hot. Static pressure optimised fans help with performance on radiators.

Since there are a lot of fans, check my [Fan Buying Guide](https://github.com/ozone3950/fan-buying-guide) repository.


## Pumps
As the name suggests, it pumps the water around the loop, in order to cool all of the liquid down.

##### MCP665
##### VPP755


## Reservoirs
Reservoirs aren't actually manditory, like in some SFF builds, but most pumps require to be used with a reservoir. They are used to fill up the loop and contain more liquid.

##### Barrow
##### EK-XRES
##### Heatkiller Tube


## Tubes
Tubes transfer the water around the loop. There's two types of tubing - soft and hard.

**Soft:** 
##### EK-ZMT 16/10mm
##### EPDM 13/10mm


## Fittings
Fittings attach the tubes to the cooling part. Different fittings are used for soft and hard tubing.

**Compression:**
##### Barrow
##### Bitspower
##### Corsair Hydro X


## Coolant
The coolant is the liquid/water that fills the loop. It is specially optimised to be a good thermal conductor.
