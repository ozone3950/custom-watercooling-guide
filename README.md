# Custom Watercooling

## Introduction

Custom watercooling is mainly used for high end components in order to cool them sufficiently when overclocked. Parts are bought seperately, making it more customisable. They also cool a lot better than mainstream AIO liquid coolers. 

# Parts

## Waterblock
The waterblock is the part of the loop which cools the CPU or GPU. It is mounted onto it like a regular CPU cooler, but has two tubes going into it, screwed on by fittings.

## Radiators
As the component which is being cooled heats up, so does the water that it is being cooled by. The water flows through the radiator and is cooled by the fans.

## Fans
Fans cool the radiator, since they get hot. Static pressure optimised fans help with performance on radiators.

## Pump
As the name suggests, it pumps the water around the loop, in order to cool all of the liquid down.

## Reservoir
Reservoirs aren't actually manditory, like in some SFF builds, but most pumps require to be used with a reservoir. They are used to fill up the loop and contain more liquid.

## Tubes
Tubes transfer the water around the loop. There's two types of tubing - soft and hard.

## Fittings
Fittings attach the tubes to the cooling part. Different fittings are used for soft and hard tubing.

## Coolant
The coolant is the liquid/water that fills the loop. It is specially optimised to be a good thermal conductor.
